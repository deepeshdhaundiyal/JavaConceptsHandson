This vs Super?? Cope constructor??
We all know about constructor that they have same name as class name, No return type.
Java differentiates constructors based on the number and types of parameters.
They are invoked automatically when an object is created.

Do you know constructor Cannot be Static, Final, or Abstract. Do you know about the Copy Constructor?
Do you know we can create a constructor private to restrict the object creation. (Singleton pattern)

Types of constructors :-

Default constructor : A constructor that we do not need to create and called out when an object is created.
Parametrised Constructor : A constructor that required parameters to pass on while initialising an object.
Copy Constructor : Initialises an object using another object of the same class.

 //Parametrised Constructor : A constructor that required parameters to pass on while initialising an object.
    ConstructorConcepts(int x, String value){
        System.out.println("Parameterised constructor is called...");
        this.x = x;
        this.name = value;
    }

 //Copy Constructor : Initializes an object using another object of the same class.
    ConstructorConcepts(ConstructorConcepts constructorConcepts){
        System.out.println("Copy constructor is called...");
        this.x = constructorConcepts.x;
        this.name = constructorConcepts.name;
    }

Constructor Chaining
Within the Same Class: Use this() to call another constructor.
From Parent Class: Use super() to call a parent class constructor.
