Java exceptional handling encompasses various types:

- Checked Exceptions: Must be declared or handled (e.g., IOException, SQLException).
- Unchecked Exceptions: Subclasses of RuntimeException, not mandated to be caught or declared (e.g., NullPointerException, ArithmeticException).
- Multiple Catch Blocks: Handle different exception types in distinct catch blocks.
- Try-Catch-Finally: The finally block always executes, beneficial for cleanup operations.
- Throwing Exceptions: Explicitly throw exceptions using the throw keyword.
- Custom Exceptions: Develop custom exception classes to denote application-specific errors.
- Try-With-Resources: Automatically closes resources to prevent resource leaks.
